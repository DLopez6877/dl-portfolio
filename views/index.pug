        h1 About
      p#bio Daniel Lopez is a web developer, web designer, and full-time geek. He spends most of his time inside his humble abode in front of his computer in Vancouver, WA. Although he is a simple man, he likes to dabble in complex theories and considers himself a tinker of things and stuff. You could imagine his excitement when he discovered Arduino boards for the first time a few months ago. Can you say, “instant hobby”? Although his bio is a bit odd and he is referring to himself in the third person, Daniel is a delightful character that strides headfirst into new challenges.

          h3 About
          h5 P.O.L.L.I. was created over the span of 6 days at Epicodus. Isabella Abatgis and I paired with John Dowd and Pete Lazuran from the C# cohort to create something that had never been done at Epicodus before. A robotic arm that mimics your hand motion and saves a log of it's movements to a database for data analytics.
          h3 My roles
          h5 Build robot, Johnny-Five, MongoDB, express middleware, front-end interface, project proposal, and README.md
          h3 Process
          h5 The first two days of the project were spent physically building the robot as a team and doing research. We made a document that outlined the project plan and formally proposed the idea to the instructor for approval. Once the arm was constructed I began setting up a MEAN stack application and running tests to communicate with an LED from the web browser. By the weekend I was able to control the LED but was unable to successfully communicate with the robots board through the arduino.
          h5 The following Monday we had a breakthrough when we removed the robotic arms board and connected the servo motors directly to the arduino board. Unfortunately, the breakthrough was only working on a simple test server we had setup without the MEAN stack and due to the short timeframe we abandoned the MEAN stack repository. I knew I was close to getting everything to work which later motivated me to make a drink mixing robot.
          h5 From that point forward, I focused my attention on working with Isabella to design to build the interface while John and Pete worked on logging the movements and connecting the input fields to the Johnny-Five methods.

          p Dad Joke Generator was a group project created during the CSS course at Epicodus. Members were Corey Redding, Justin Gomez, Calvin Cushman, and Daniel Lopez. The project was created over 4 days. All the images on the home screen were drawn by Corey Redding. 
          p Corey primarily worked on the drawings and then animations. Justin and Calvin primarily worked on adding jokes and then animations. I worked on migrating the animations from code pen, user-interface, and layout.

          p Find a Doctor was an independent project created during the Javascript course at Epicodus. The project was created over one weekend and was designed to test our knowledge of api calls and gulp. Uses both betterdoctor api and googlemaps api.
          p I wanted to design the webpage to have a friendly medical feel so I went with the color blue. The layout was loosly based off of a DevTips (Devin Allen) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMW0bmrb2n4">youtube video</a> about full screen models and splash pages.

          p Drinken is an automated bartender machine. As a user you are able to select a drink, then select the size you want and press the pour drink button. Drinken will then pour you a drink based on the recipe programmed into the database as the button animates to work as a countdown timer for when your drink will be ready. You are also able to add, edit, and delete drinks from the interface. It currently is located in my living room connected to a Rasberry Pi 3 so I can have it pour me drinks from my phone.
          p Technologies used: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular2, Node.js, Johnny-Five, Sass, Cura(3d printing)
          p I decided to do this project because while researching how to build a robotic arm (P.O.L.L.I.) I came across a lot of similar automated bartender projects. One of which was from <a href="http://yujiangtham.com/2014/05/25/build-your-very-own-drink-mixing-robot-part-1/">Yu Jiang Tham</a> who provided .STL files for the structure that could be 3d printed and a great reference at times.
