He spends most of his time inside his humble abode in front of his computer in Vancouver, WA. Although he is a simple man, he likes to dabble in complex theories and considers himself a tinker of things and stuff. You could imagine his excitement when he discovered Arduino boards for the first time a few months ago. Can you say, “instant hobby”? Although his bio is a bit odd and he is referring to himself in the third person, Daniel is a delightful character that strides headfirst into new challenges.</p><ul><li> <a href="https://codepen.io/DLopez6877/">Codepen: <span>https://codepen.io/DLopez6877/</span></a></li><br/><br/><li>Employment Status: <span>Looking for a job.</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Book: <span>Ready Player One</span></li><br/><li>Favorite TV Show: <span>Rick and Morty</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Video Game: <span>Fifa</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Soccer Team: <span>Portland Timbers</span></li><br/></ul></div><div class="container" id="project-container"><div class="container-head" id="projects-anchor"><h1>Projects</h1><div class="pagination"><div class="page-link active-page-link page-link1"></div><div class="page-link page-link2"></div><div class="page-link page-link3"></div><div class="page-link page-link4"></div><div class="page-link page-link5"></div><h5><span id="prev"><i>←</i> previous</span> | <span id="next">next <i>→</i></span></h5></div></div><div class="feature-wrapper" id="project1"><div class="featured-project"><h2>P.O.L.L.I.</h2><div class="tldr"><h5>The robotic arm that you can control with hand motion or through a mobile-friendly website.</h5><h5>Technologies: Node.js, Socket.io, Johnny-Five, Express, Leap Motion Controller, Arduino Uno, JQuery</h5><div class="learn-more" id="project1-more">Learn more</div></div><div class="additional-infos"><a href="https://sigtaba.github.io/P.O.L.L.I/"><div class="additional-info">View Site</div></a><a href="https://github.com/irishdowd10/P.O.L.L.I"><div class="additional-info">View Code</div></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-coaPPl-Yk&amp;feature=youtu.be"><div class="additional-info">Video</div></a></div><div class="featured-project-image project1"><img src="/assets/images/devices1.png"/></div></div><div class="description"><p>P.O.L.L.I is an interactive robotic arm that can be controlled through a mobile-friendly website or by hand motion.
