He spends most of his time inside his humble abode in front of his computer in Vancouver, WA. Although he is a simple man, he likes to dabble in complex theories and considers himself a tinker of things and stuff. You could imagine his excitement when he discovered Arduino boards for the first time a few months ago. Can you say, “instant hobby”? Although his bio is a bit odd and he is referring to himself in the third person, Daniel is a delightful character that strides headfirst into new challenges.</p><ul><li> <a href="https://codepen.io/DLopez6877/">Codepen: <span>https://codepen.io/DLopez6877/</span></a></li><br/><br/><li>Employment Status: <span>Looking for a job.</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Book: <span>Ready Player One</span></li><br/><li>Favorite TV Show: <span>Rick and Morty</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Video Game: <span>Fifa</span></li><br/><li>Favorite Soccer Team: <span>Portland Timbers</span></li><br/></ul></div><div class="container" id="project-container"><div class="container-head" id="projects-anchor"><h1>Projects</h1><div class="pagination"><div class="page-link active-page-link page-link1"></div><div class="page-link page-link2"></div><div class="page-link page-link3"></div><div class="page-link page-link4"></div><div class="page-link page-link5"></div><h5><span id="prev"><i>←</i> previous</span> | <span id="next">next <i>→</i></span></h5></div></div><div class="feature-wrapper" id="project1"><h2>P.O.L.L.I.</h2><div class="featured-project"><div class="tldr"><h5>The robotic arm that you can control with hand motion or through a mobile-friendly website.</h5><h5>Technologies: Node.js, Socket.io, Johnny-Five, Express, Leap Motion Controller, Arduino Uno, JQuery</h5><a href="#projects-anchor"><div class="learn-more">Learn more</div></a></div><div class="additional-infos"><a href="https://sigtaba.github.io/P.O.L.L.I/"><div class="additional-info">View Site</div></a><a href="https://github.com/irishdowd10/P.O.L.L.I"><div class="additional-info">View Code</div></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-coaPPl-Yk&amp;feature=youtu.be"><div class="additional-info">Video</div></a></div><div class="featured-project-image project1"><img src="/assets/images/devices1.png"/></div></div><div class="description"><h3>About</h3><h5>P.O.L.L.I. was created over the span of 6 days at Epicodus. Isabella Abatgis and I paired with John Dowd and Pete Lazuran from the C# cohort to create something that had never been done at Epicodus before. A robotic arm that mimics your hand motion and saves a log of it's movements to a database for data analytics.</h5><h3>My roles</h3><h5>Build robot, Johnny-Five, MongoDB, express middleware, front-end interface, project proposal, and README.md</h5><h3>Process</h3><h5>The first two days of the project were spent physically building the robot as a team and doing research. We made a document that outlined the project plan and formally proposed the idea to the instructor for approval. Once the arm was constructed I began setting up a MEAN stack application and running tests to communicate with an LED from the web browser. By the weekend I was able to control the LED but was unable to successfully communicate with the robots board through the arduino.</h5><h5>The following Monday we had a breakthrough when we removed the robotic arms board and connected the servo motors directly to the arduino board. Unfortunately, the breakthrough was only working on a simple test server we had setup without the MEAN stack and due to the short timeframe we abandoned the MEAN stack repository. I knew I was close to getting everything to work which later motivated me to make a drink mixing robot.</h5><h5>From that point forward, I focused my attention on working with Isabella to design to build the interface while John and Pete worked on logging the movements and connecting the input fields to the Johnny-Five methods.</h5><a href="#projects-anchor"><div class="back-overview"><i>←</i>back to overview</div></a></div></div><div class="feature-wrapper initially-hidden" id="project2"><h2>⑇simpleColor</h2><div class="featured-project"><div class="tldr"><h5>A color theory website that allows you to say or type a color and receive color pallette information without all the confusing gizmos.</h5><h5>Technologies: Gulp, NPM, p5.speech.js, tinycolor.js, thecolorapi, JQuery, Ajax, Sass</h5><a href="#projects-anchor"><div class="learn-more">Learn more</div></a></div><div class="additional-infos"><a href="https://dlopez6877.github.io/simpleColor/"><div class="additional-info">View Site</div></a><a href="https://github.com/DLopez6877/simpleColor"><div class="additional-info">View Code</div></a></div><div class="featured-project-image project2"><img src="/assets/images/devices2.png"/></div></div><div class="description"><h3>About</h3><h5>I was frustrated with all the extra features color pallette sites have so I created simple color. The idea is to make it as simple as possible to enter a color and get back hexcodes of the related colors you want.</h5><h3>Process</h3><h5>I began ⑇simpleColor during the "bring your own project night" at the monthly front-end PDX meetup I attend. At the time, the only project I was working on was for my internship at ScoutSavvy and I wanted to work on something new. I kept everything to one font, vanilla css, and no javascript framework to keep with the theme of a simple website.</h5><h5>The original idea was to do the calculations on converting a hexcode into different color combinations but during research I discovered tinycolor.js which had most of the information I already wanted. Later on I decided to add the voice recognition because "Code Train" (a youtube channel I enjoy about p5.js) introduced the new p5 speech recognition addon developed by NYU. Once I had reached mvp I sent a link to my former epicodus classmates asking for feedback.</h5><h5>After getting some user feedback, I added the neutral colors, added safeguards on double clicking the hexcodes which was copying the string "COPIED!" to the clipboard, made it so that the text is highlighted when you click on the input field, and other minor bugs related to the speech input.</h5><a href="#projects-anchor"><div class="back-overview"><i>←</i>back to overview</div></a></div></div><div class="feature-wrapper initially-hidden" id="project3"><h2>Find a Doctor</h2><div class="featured-project"><div class="tldr"><h5>Need a doctor?
